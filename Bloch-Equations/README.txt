OPTICAL BLOCH EQUATIONS SIMULATION

Versions

	- Standard BOE (blochEq.py)
	- OBE with additional decay (blochEqDecay.py)

DATE: Fri Feb 22 16:48:14 CET 2019


New scripts:

	- OBE with decay in a supra-molecule picture with N-atoms
	ensembles (blochEqDecayRBR.py)
	- OBE with decay in a supra-molecule picture with dephasing in
	the |e> Rydberg state (blochEqDecayRBR_v2.py)
	- OBE with decay in a supra-molecule picture with dephasing in
	the Rydberg state and interaction between ensembles (blochEqDecayRBR_Interac.py)

	NOTE: realistic values were introduced.

New scripts: 

	- Interacting OBE solve the 4x4 dimensional density matrix. (inter_beta.py)
	- Mathematica notebooks for solve the master equation (von Neunmann eq.)

	NOTE: still is not working the Rabi's oscillations [IMPORTANT TO SOLVE]
