Version Beta VB1_PM

	- Acquires data from data structure
	- Calculates the fitting of the data
	- Calculates the difference between minima of the fits
	- Calculates angular difference between data (hysteresis behaviour)


	Things to be fix:

    	- Fix setpath2dir()
    	- Fix loadata()
    	- Include dGauss() and pod_difM() which is necessary for double gaussians
    	- Include minima, maxima, peaks and derivative analysis pks(), cvalues()
    	- Include convolve method discv()
    	- Include error bars
    	- Fix plots for data and fit in the same figure
    	- Fix details of figure plots
    	- Fix order of lecture folders
    	- Check x-axis missmatching with the .csv
